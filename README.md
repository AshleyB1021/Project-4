Current practice in hospital is to collect required information for diabetes diagnosis through various tests and appropriate treatment is provided based on diagnosis. Big Data Analytics plays an significant role in healthcare industries. Healthcare industries have large volume databases. Using big data analytics one can study huge datasets and find hidden information, hidden patterns to discover knowledge from the data and predict outcomes accordingly.In existing method, we have proposed a diabetes prediction model for better classification of diabetes which includes few external factors responsible for diabetes along with regular factors .
in the model The model achieved an accuracy of approximately 86.59%, indicating that it correctly classified 86.59% of the samples in the test set.
