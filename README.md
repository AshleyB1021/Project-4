# Diabetes Prediction Project

## Introduction:
Diabetes affects  over 537 million people around the world , making it the deadliest and the most common non‚Äêcommunicable disease.  According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), in 2021, 38.4 million Americans, or 11.6% of the population, had diabetes. Additionally, 1.2 Million Americans are diagnosed with Diabetes every year.


## Overview:
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on health indicators from the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) dataset. By analyzing various health-related factors, we seek to build a predictive model that can assist healthcare professionals in identifying individuals at higher risk of developing diabetes.


## Data Exploration:
The data exploration process involved analyzing the dataset's structure, contents, and statistical properties. Descriptive statistics, visualizations, and exploratory data analysis techniques were used to gain insights into the dataset and identify relevant variables for predictive modeling.

## Model Development:
The model development process included data preprocessing, train-test splitting, model selection, training, evaluation, and interpretation. Logistic regression was chosen as the initial model due to its simplicity and interpretability. 

## Results:
The developed machine learning model achieved promising performance in predicting diabetes based on health indicators. The model attained an accuracy of 86.59%, indicating its ability to correctly classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic. Furthermore, the ROC-AUC score, a measure of the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes, was found to be 82.64%, demonstrating good discrimination ability. Evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score were also analyzed to provide a comprehensive assessment of the model's performance. Additionally, feature importance analysis revealed insights into the key factors influencing diabetes prediction, aiding in understanding the underlying relationships between health indicators and diabetes risk. Overall, the results demonstrate the efficacy of the developed model in predicting diabetes and provide valuable insights for healthcare practitioners and researchers.
